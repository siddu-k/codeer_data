Certainly! Here's a simple Python script that tells a story about Hanuman using print statements:

```python
def hanuman_story():
    print("Once upon a time in ancient India, there lived a mighty monkey god named Hanuman.")
    print("He was known for his incredible strength, agility, and devotion to Lord Rama.")
    
    print("\nOne day, Sita, the wife of Lord Rama, was abducted by the demon king Ravana.")
    print("Lord Rama, distraught over her disappearance, sought the help of Hanuman.")
    
    print("\nWith his unwavering loyalty, Hanuman leaped across the ocean to reach the island of Lanka.")
    print("There, he found Sita, who was in despair. Hanuman reassured her and promised to bring Rama to rescue her.")
    
    print("\nHanuman fought valiantly against Ravana's army, displaying his immense power.")
    print("He used his magical powers to grow in size, and he caused chaos among the demons.")
    
    print("\nAfter defeating many foes, Hanuman returned to Rama with Sita's message.")
    print("Rama, filled with gratitude, gathered an army of bears and monkeys to rescue Sita.")
    
    print("\nTogether, they waged a fierce battle against Ravana and his forces.")
    print("With Hanuman's help, Lord Rama ultimately defeated Ravana and rescued Sita.")
    
    print("\nHanuman's bravery and devotion were celebrated throughout the land.")
    print("He became a symbol of strength, loyalty, and selfless service, revered by millions.")
